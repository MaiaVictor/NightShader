### NightShader

---

An envisioned cartoonish shader with strong emphasis on dynamism and cinematic effects. A 3D engine with less focus in raw computing power, and more focus in achieving the astonishing visuals you see you see in hand-drawn animation; see the [/effects_wishlist](https://github.com/MaiaVictor/NightShader/tree/master/effects_wishlist) directory for an overview of the desired effects. It is much more of a desire/inspiration than anything concrete. I know the end goal, but I'm very far from achieving it, and I'm not sure how/if I ever will. I'll not worry too much, and let NightShader evolve naturally as ideas flow. Regardless of what comes out of this, this will be the base of my future indie game projects.

Initially I plan to use a [Tibia-like](http://asset.100.ggftw.net/gallery/images/174/1_guildhall.jpg) projection only, since this is what my first game will use. It is not a thing for all tastes, but is something I need to do. Different projections will be implemented in future versions.

Uses [WebMonkeys](https://github.com/MaiaVictor/WebMonkeys) for GPU rendering.
